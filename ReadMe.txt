To run code for tracking.

  RunCode_Tracking_Batch.m 
  
The input and output file paths are written in 

  RunCode_VAMC.m
  
Input frame and ground truth are located in each folder as image files in the order of frame number.
You must use the same names for input and ground truth corresponding to the same frame.
I recemmend you to set the frame name as frame number, for example, 00001.jpg, 00002.jpg ... 02038.jpg.


  Any questions are welcome.
